# [Visual-textual Dermatoglyphic Animal Biometrics: A First Case Study on Panthera tigris](https://github.com/wenshuoli001/vt-tiger-bio.github.io)

## Abstract
Biologists have long combined photographs and sketches with textual field notes to re-identify (Re-ID) individual animals based on phenotypic traits. Contemporary AI-supported camera trapping builds on this visual tradition, with computer vision tools now supporting animal re-identification across numerous species with distinctive morphological features, such as unique stripe-like coats (e.g., zebras, tigers). Here, we present the first study to extend image-only Re-ID methodologies by incorporating precise dermatoglyphic textual descriptors -- an approach widely used in forensic science but hitherto unexploited in ecology. We demonstrate that these specialist semantics can abstract and encode both the topology and structure of animal stripe coats using fully human-interpretable language tags. Drawing on 84,264 manually labelled minutiae features across 3,355 images of 185 individual tigers (Panthera tigris), we provide a comprehensive quantitative case study evaluating this new visual–textual methodology in detail, revealing novel capabilities for cross-modal dermatoglyphic animal identity retrieval. To optimise performance we synthesise 2,000 ‘virtual individuals’ multimodally, each comprising dozens of life-like tiger visuals in ecologically credible camera trap configurations paired with matching dermatoglyphic text descriptors of visible coat features. Benchmarking against real-world camera trap Re-ID scenarios shows that such augmentation can double AI accuracy in cross-modal retrieval while alleviating challenges of data scarcity for rare species and expert annotation bottlenecks. We conclude that dermatoglyphic language-guided animal biometrics can overcome key limitations of vision-only solutions and, for the first time, enable textual-to-visual identity recovery underpinned by human-verifiable minutiae matchings. Conceptually, this represents a significant advance towards explainability in Re-ID and a broader language-driven unification of descriptive modalities in AI-based ecological monitoring.
